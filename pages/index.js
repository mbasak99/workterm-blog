      <p>
        Hey, I'm Monark Basak. I'm 21 years old and currently attending the
        University of Guelph pursuing a Bachelor of Computing degree as a
        Software Engineering student. As of writing this, I've finished an 8
        month term co-op and about to enter the 3rd year of my program. I've
        recently finished working at Kenna working as a Fullstack Developer and
        really enjoyed working with technologies pertaining to the web.
