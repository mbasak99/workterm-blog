        <p>
          A huge shoutout to Kenna, first of all, when I received the co-op
          offer (and promptly accepted) COVID-19 troubles were right around the
          corner but I was assured that I would still be able intern and they
          would provide all their interns with equipment to safely work from
          home. I was immensely grateful as I know not everyone in the co-op
          program could say the same.
