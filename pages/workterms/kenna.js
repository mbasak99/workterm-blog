        <p>
          A huge shoutout to Kenna, first of all, when I received the co-op
          offer (which I promptly accepted) COVID-19 troubles were right around
          the corner but I was assured that all incoming and existing co-op
          students would still be able intern and they would provide all of
          their interns with all the necessary equipment to safely work from
          home. I was immensely grateful as I know not everyone in the co-op
          program could say the same. I also want to shoutout the great people
          comprising Kenna for making the 8-month term enjoyable by hosting many
          social events and activites as there were many events that had all the
          employees from all the departments get together online and just have
          fun, discuss topics, and/or learn something. I also would like to
          shoutout the amazing developers I was fortunate enough to work with,
          there was always someone ready to lend a hand whether it was to point
          me to the right place for something, helping debugging a piece of
          code, or anything else really. And last, but definitely not least, I
          want to give a huge shoutout to my mentor and supervisor Nicholas
          Paul, who took me under his wing and taught me so much about the tools
          and technolgies I'd have to work with, for being patient and
          understanding when I was stuck, and always being able to find the time
          to help me out.
