        <p>
          A huge shoutout to Kenna, first of all, when I received the co-op
          offer (which I promptly accepted) COVID-19 troubles were right around
          the corner but I was assured that all incoming and existing co-op
          students would still be able intern and they would provide all their
          interns with all the necessary equipment to safely work from home. I
          was immensely grateful as I know not everyone in the co-op program
          could say the same. I also want to shoutout the great people
          comprising Kenna for making the 8-month term enjoyable by hosting as
          there were many events that had all the employees get together online
          and just have fun, discuss topics, and/or learn something.
