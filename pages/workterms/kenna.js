        <h2>First Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I was a bit nervous when I first started out since it was my first
          ever co-op work term, and I had never coded in a professional
          environment before. I was also worried whether I'd be able to pick
          things up that are specifc to Kenna such as utilizing certain tools in
          a specific way, or things of that nature. But looking back now I think
          that was foolish as I had great support from fellow developers and my
          mentor who were always willing to lend a hand when I was stuck. Kenna
          also documented their tools, projects and practically everything else
          very well, if there's a question to be asked, it's probably been
          answered in their Confluence documentation, and if it's not, then
          you're encouraged to add to the documentation to help those in the
          future.

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
          Working across the many projects I had been placed on, I've learned so
          much from when I first started out. One of the first things I learned
          was certain projects had to support older and outdated browsers which
          can sometimes be a huge pain, I'm looking at you IE11.

        <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
        <p>
          A huge shoutout to Kenna, first of all, when I received the co-op
          offer (which I promptly accepted) COVID-19 troubles were right around
          the corner but I was assured that all incoming and existing co-op
          students would still be able to work during their term(s) and they
          would provide everyone with all the necessary equipment to safely work
          from home. I was immensely grateful as I know not everyone in the
          co-op program could say the same. I also want to shoutout the great
          people comprising Kenna for making the 8-month term enjoyable by
          hosting many social events and activites as there were many events
          that had all the employees from all the departments get together
          online and just have fun, discuss topics, and/or learn something. I
          also would like to shoutout the amazing developers I was fortunate
          enough to work with, there was always someone ready to lend a hand
          whether it was to point me to the right place for something, helping
          debugging a piece of code, or anything else really. And last, but
          definitely not least, I want to give a huge shoutout to my mentor and
          supervisor Nicholas Paul, who took me under his wing and taught me so
          much about the tools and technolgies I'd have to work with, for being
          patient and understanding when I was stuck, and always being able to
          find the time to help me out even when his schedule would get hectic.
